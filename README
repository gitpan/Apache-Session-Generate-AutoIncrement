NAME
    Apache::Session::Generate::AutoIncrement - Use monotonically increasing
    IDs

SYNOPSIS
     use Apache::Session::Generate::AutoIncrement;
 
     $id = Apache::Session::Generate::AutoIncrement::generate();

DESCRIPTION
    This module fulfills the ID generation interface of Apache::Session. The
    IDs are generated using a monotonically increasing counter value. This
    counter is file-based using the File::Counter module, so it is probably
    not very efficient and fast.

    This module can also examine session IDs to ensure that they are,
    indeed, session ID numbers and not evil attacks. The reader is
    encouraged to consider the effect of bogus session ID numbers in a
    system which uses these ID numbers to access disks and databases.

    This modules takes two arguments in the usual Apache::Session style. The
    first argument is IDLength, and the value, between 0 and 32, tells this
    modulevwhere to truncate the session ID. Without this argument, the
    session ID will be 10 digits. The second argument is CounterFile, which
    is the file in which the counted value will reside. This parameter is
    given directly to the File::Counter module.
